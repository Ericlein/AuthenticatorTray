# Eric's Super Duper Secure Auth™ 🔐

> *Because who needs Google Authenticator when you can roll your own sketchy system tray app?*

## What is this monstrosity?

Welcome to the most "enterprise-grade" 2FA authenticator you've ever seen! This beautiful piece of software engineering is a Windows system tray application that generates TOTP codes. It's like Google Authenticator, but with 100% more hardcoded values and 0% architectural patterns!

## Features That Will Make You Question Everything

- ✨ **Single-file architecture** - Why use multiple files when you can cram 1000+ lines into one massive Program.cs?
- 🎨 **"Modern" UI** - Rounded corners! Subtle shadows! It's basically the next macOS!
- 📱 **Actually Responsive Design** - Uses em units and screen percentages like a real web developer!
- 🔒 **Security First** - All your secrets are safely embedded as resources (what could go wrong?)
- 🚀 **Blazing Fast** - Updates every 500ms whether you need it or not!
- 💾 **Memory Efficient** - Calls `GC.Collect()` manually because we're performance experts
- 🎯 **Production Ready** - Contains helpful comments like `// Better vertical centering`
- ⚙️ **QR Code Import** - Add new accounts on the fly! Just click the settings icon and scan a QR code. No rebuilds needed!

## Installation

### Step 1: Export Your 2FA Accounts from Google Authenticator

1. Open Google Authenticator on your phone
2. Tap the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top right
3. Select **"Export accounts"** or **"Transfer accounts"**
4. Choose **"Export accounts"** and select the accounts you want to export
5. Google Authenticator will display a QR code containing all your accounts
6. **Take a screenshot** of the QR code

### Step 2: Add the QR Code Image to the Repository

1. Save the screenshot as `img.png` in the root directory of this repository (same folder as `setup.py`)
2. Make sure the image is clearly visible and the QR code is not cropped or distorted

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the repository root directory
2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

   The script will:
   - Install required Python dependencies (protobuf, pyzbar, Pillow)
   - Generate the protobuf file needed for parsing migration URLs
   - Decode the QR code from `img.png`
   - Extract all your 2FA accounts
   - Create `accounts.json` in the `csharp-tray/AuthenticatorTray/` directory
   - If `accounts.json` already exists, it will create `updated_accounts.json` instead

### Step 4: Build and Run the Application

1. Navigate to the C# project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AuthenticatorTray
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:SelfContained=true
   ```

### Usage

- **Left-click** the tray icon to show all your 2FA codes
- **Right-click** the tray icon to exit the application
- **Click the settings icon (⚙️)** in the popup header to add new accounts via QR code
- Codes update automatically every second

## Configuration

The `accounts.json` file is automatically generated by the setup script from your Google Authenticator export. However, if you need to manually create or edit it, use this format:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "Your Bank Account (totally safe)",
      "secret": "DEFINITELY_NOT_YOUR_REAL_SECRET",
      "digits": 6,
      "algorithm": "SHA1"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Note: This file is in .gitignore because we learned about security the hard way.*

### Adding New Accounts via UI

**The Easy Way (Recommended):**

1. When setting up 2FA on a website (e.g., Microsoft, GitHub, etc.), they'll show you a QR code
2. **Take a screenshot** of the QR code (or save it as an image file)
3. **Left-click** the tray icon to open the popup
4. **Click the settings icon (⚙️)** in the popup header
5. Click **"📷 Scan QR Code from Image"**
6. Select your screenshot/image file
7. Review the account information and click **"Add Account"**
8. Done! The new account appears immediately - no rebuild needed!

The account is automatically saved to `accounts.json` in the application directory, so it persists across restarts.

### Manual Account Entry

If you prefer to manually add accounts instead of using the export or QR scanning:
1. Copy the example file: `cp accounts.json.example accounts.json`
2. Edit `accounts.json` and add your accounts with their TOTP secrets
3. Each account needs: `name`, `secret` (base32 encoded), `digits` (usually 6), and `algorithm` (usually "SHA1")
4. Restart the application to load the new accounts

## Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used:
- ❌ MVC
- ❌ MVVM  
- ❌ Repository Pattern
- ❌ Dependency Injection
- ✅ **The "Everything in Main" Pattern** (Patent Pending)

### Code Quality Features:
- **CSS-like Units**: `Em(4.2f)` and `ScreenWidth(22)` - we're basically web developers now!
- **Inline Event Handlers**: Because separating concerns is overrated
- **Custom Graphics Extensions**: Why use existing UI frameworks when you can draw rounded rectangles manually?
- **Global State**: Static methods everywhere, just like the good old days!
- **DPI Awareness**: `Application.SetHighDpiMode(HighDpiMode.PerMonitorV2)` - look how fancy we are!

## Known "Features"

- 🎉 ~~Hardcoded window positioning~~ **FIXED!** Now uses screen percentages like a pro!
- 🎉 ~~Blurry text~~ **FIXED!** Crystal clear DPI-aware rendering!
- 🎉 ~~Terrible scaling~~ **FIXED!** Responsive em-based layout system!
- 🎉 ~~Need to rebuild to add accounts~~ **FIXED!** Just scan a QR code and you're done!
- 🐛 No error handling for malformed JSON (crashes are features!)
- 🐛 Memory leaks? What memory leaks? We call `GC.Collect()`!
- 🐛 Thread safety is for enterprise applications
- 🐛 No unit tests (testing is for people who don't believe in their code)

## FAQ

**Q: Why does this exist?**  
A: I was tired of using my phone.

**Q: Is this secure?**  
A: As secure as storing your passwords in a text file named "definitely_not_passwords.txt"

**Q: Can I use this in production?**  
A: You *can* do many things. Should you? That's between you and your conscience.

**Q: Why is everything in one file?**  
A: Microservices are overrated. We're bringing back the monolith, one giant Program.cs at a time.

**Q: Why does it look like macOS?**  
A: Don't flatter me, it looks like shit.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Great! Here's how you can help:

1. ~~Fork the repository~~
2. ~~Create a feature branch~~
3. ~~Write tests~~
4. Just edit Program.cs directly and add more inline code. It's the way.
